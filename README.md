# GoDutch

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

- Required: User can enter the bill amount

- Optional: added a custom icon image
- Optional: added a custom font Salesforce Sans, and changed the font colors/sizes throughout the app

Had some trouble with these features:
- overriding the standard clear button with my own image
- adding a comma when a number exceeds 3 characters
- setting a default tip value that is not the the 0 index of the segmented control 
- begrudgingly had some trouble formatting the LaunchImage
